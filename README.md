bplistlib -- read binary .plist files. No write support.

Functions: 

These two functions are analagous to the readPlist and readPlistFromString
functions available in plistlib:

readBPlist
readBPlistFromString

These two functions can discriminate between an XML plist file and a binary
plist file, and run the appropriate functions to parse that file:

readAnyPlist
readAnyPlistFromString
